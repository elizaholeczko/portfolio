# Portfolio Eliza Holeczko

## **About me**
I have been interested in the world of computers since I was a child. I graduated from a technical school in the profession of Digital Graphic Processes Technician, I received a diploma which confirms my skills. At school, I created graphics, edited films, took photos and processed them in programs such as Adobe Xd, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and After Effects.
I found my first side job during the holidays at the age of 14, which can be a proof of my diligence.
I decided to carrer change, because until now I have not felt professionally fulfilled and I had no prospects for development.
